## Packages used

- [body-parser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/body-parser)
- [mongodb](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongodb)
- [express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express)
- [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv)

## Downloading and installing packages locally

Make sure you have first made your folder a npm project. To do so, open your folder in the integrated terminal, then run
```
npm init -y
```

These packages are public, which means they can be searched, downloaded or installed by anyone. To install a public package, on the command line, run
```
npm install <package_name>
```
Or the shortened version
```
npm i <package_name>
```
To make your life easier, and mine, well... not so much

```
npm i body-parser
```
```
npm i mongodb
```
```
npm i express
```
```
npm i dotenv
```
For those who are curious and would like to read more about using packages or modules, make sure to visit [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/). and read their [docs](https://docs.npmjs.com/).
